Generating the HP filter figures in EViews from the Time Series dataset.

Step1 Data preparation
First, manually merging the 3 excel sheets created by Stata, and loading the merged sheet into EViews

Step 2 Applying the HP Filter
HP Filter applied via GUI:
Method: Use Proc > HP Filter in the series window
Lambda: 1600 (appropriate for quarterly data)

All income groups
- Series: totent
- Lambda: 1600
- Output: tote_all

Low income group
- Series: totent_low
- Lambda: 1600
- Output: tote_low

High income group
- Series: totent_high
- Lambda: 1600
- Output: tote_high

Store output as: Trend components (tote_all, tote_low, tote_high)

Step 3 Visualization
Afterwards, grouping the 3 outputs and producing a simple line graph for them:
Create group with code:
group group1 tote_all tote_low tote_high
Open the group â†’ click View > Graph > Line to generate the comparison plot.

Export the graph via:
click Object > View Options > Copy to Clipboard
